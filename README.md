Takes two genetic sequences as a string and finds their similarity. Produce a numerical score by giving a penalty if there is a gap (2) and mismatch (1).
•	Implemented with dynamic programming to find the optimal alignment of two genetic sequences.
•	Program makes use of a 2D array to keep track of the cost between the two sequences
